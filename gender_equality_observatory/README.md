![alt text](GenderEquality-HERO.jpg?raw=true)

## Motivation

The term "gender balance" refers to an equitable distribution of life's opportunities and resources between women and men, and/or the equal representation of women and men. In science and academia inequalities exist in different career stages from postgraduate level to top-tier academia.

## Description

This work aims to create a gender balance observatory on scientific research, by exploring curated data extracted from Google Scholar. More specifically, we created a web application that visualizes the analysis made on data collected for some faculty members, in order to be presented and emphasized the inequality of the two genders, in academia.
